## Summary:

Javascript variables acts like a storage box, where we can store a piece of data. There two modern way of declaring or creating a variables in JavaScript:

1. let - variable allow us to declare a variable and change the value on the fly.
2. const - variable allow us to declare a variable with a constant value. the developer cannot change the constant value through reassignment, when we use const.

## Tips:

1. Always use const variable if you are not changing the value, through reassignment.
2. The name of your variable must be in camelCase format for convention.
